### Traffic light detection and classification module

The project is done with following the Self Driving Cars course at Udacity.

*LeNet* neural network was chosen as an architecture. Due to simplicity and performance on such tasks. 
Both models show accuracy above _99.3%_

The module contains two `main` methods in. 

- `detect.py`: Creates a model for detecting traffic lights
- `classify.py`: Creates a model for classification of a traffic light color.
